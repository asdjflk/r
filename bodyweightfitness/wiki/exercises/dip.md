# Dipping Progression


## General Form Cues

* Straight or slightly hollow body. No bending at the hips!
* Lock out the arms and depress the shoulderblades ([what does that even mean?](/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/positioning)) at the top
* Go as far down as you can
* Elbows in

## Recommended Progression

### [**Parallel Bar Support Hold**](http://antranik.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/antranik-holding-support-hold-on-parallel-bars.jpg)
 * Work up to 3 sets of 1 minute holds for this progression
 * [*What if I don't have parallel bars?*](http://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/wiki/exercises/dip#wiki_what_if_i_don.27t_have_parallel_bars.3F)  
 * If you can't hold yourself up at all, consider using bands or your feet to assist you until you gain the necessary strength.

### [**Negative Dips**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3Scqw1BbCc)
 * This exercise is only the descent. To get to the starting position you can jump or use a box or anything.
 * Lower yourself with control. Work up to 10 sec descents

### [**Parallel Bar Dips**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z8JmcrW-As)  

 * See general form cues.


### **Weighted Dips**
 * See general form cues
 * You can do this progression in place of ring dips.
 * We recommend to add weight to parallel bar dips first instead of ring dips.

##Alternative Progression Paths:
After you reach 3x8 Parallel Bar dips, you can choose one of these paths if you don't want to do weighted dips:

###Alternate Path 1:
#### [**Ring Dips**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Vymm8nH4wM)  

 * ***Prerequisite:*** 3x8 PB Dips + 60sec RTO Support Hold (from [Warmup](https://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/wiki/exercises/support))
 * Starting from a support position with the rings turned out, perform a dip. It's okay if the rings turn in, just make sure you turn them out at the top.
 * [*What if I don't have rings?*](http://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/wiki/exercises/dip#wiki_what_if_i_don.27t_have_rings.3F)  
 * [*What does rings turned out/RTO mean?*](/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/wiki/exercises/support)  

#### [**Rings RTO Dips**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGbtrkzIiOA&t=60s)  
 * Keep the rings turned out during the *entire* dip. You will need to lean your body or pike your hips to compensate for the ring turn

# Equipment
 * ## What if I don't have parallel bars?

* You can use two chairs to do dips on. Put some weight on the seats if you're afraid of them falling over. Another option is to find a counter top that makes a 90 degree angle, and do dips in that corner. You can also try to find two tables of the same height and do dips that way. Be creative!
* If you have rings, this will be MUCH harder, but if you build up to a solid RTO support hold *first*, you might be able to safely work negative ring dips. However, it's highly recommended you find a way to do parallel bar dips before moving to ring dips for increased safety.

 * ## What if I don't have rings?

* Beyond parallel bar dips, there's not a whole lot of dipping you can do, except for weighted dips (which are a great exercise).
* If you don't have rings or weights, we recommend you utilize the **[handstand pushup progression](/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/wiki/exercises/HSPU) after mastering parallel bar dips.**

# Frequently Asked Questions
## Why no [bench dips?](http://i.imgur.com/PeZdiQ8.jpg)
The movement pattern for bench dips is quite different due to different joint angles, which results in a very low carry over to real dips. Working on pushing strength in general with [the pushup progression](/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/wiki/exercises/pushup) to meet the prerequisites will accomplish the same.
