# Hinge Progression


## Recommended Progression

###  [**Romanian Deadlift**](https://gfycat.com/BlueUltimateBaiji)  
 * Stand up straight. Brace and squeeze your butt to flatten your low back (neutral spine to maybe slightly arched).
 * Send your butt back and lean your torso forward to avoid falling over
 * You can place the hands on your chest and abdomen for feedback or let them hang by your sides.

*Note*: The GIF is "robotic" for demonstration purposed, your execution should be smooth.


### [**Single Legged Deadlift**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDV8r5u6En0)  
 * Please ignore the barbell.
 * If you lack the balance to perform these with a leg in the air, you can use an arm to brace yourself against a surface or you can straddle your legs to help with balance. [Example](https://i.imgur.com/VUF6VLa.jpg)

## Alternate Progression Paths

After Single Legged Deadlifts, you can choose one of these instead of Banded Nordic Negatives:

###Alternate Path 1:
###**[Floor Slide Progressions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dlazt593cuA)**
 * This exercise can bridge the gap between SLDL and Nordic Curls
 * You will need a towel, socks, sliders, carpet etc. material which allows you to perform this movement smoothly. 
 * Keep PPT/Neutral Pelvis. Hands supporting at sides for support as needed. 
 * Ascend by squeezing glutes, pulling your ankles to your glutes, contracting your hamstrings. 
 * Descend by sliding ankles out under control. 

**[Negative Hamstring Slide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OY8Jci5KJdM)**

 * Start in the top position of a glute bridge, slide legs out under control until your butt touches the ground/knees are extended. 
 * Return to starting position and repeat for desired reps.

**[Hamstring Slide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dlazt593cuA)**

 * As before, but pull ankles back to glutes after eccentric movement, contracting the hamstrings and glutes.

**[Eccentric Single Leg Sliding Hamstring Slide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dE5d39sErBU)**

 * Similar to previous, but with 1 leg. Keep other leg raised, or rested on working leg.

**[Single Leg Sliding Hamstring Slide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzAtOaY1-Dk)**

 * Similar to previous, but with 1 leg. Keep other leg raised, or rested on working leg.

###Alternate Path 2:

#### [**Beginner Harop Curl**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2xRx7dGWaE)
 * Anchor your feet under something sturdy. You want to be anchored about a fist's distance away from your ankle.
 * Lower your torso by piking at the hips. Keep thighs vertical
 * Ascend by squeezing your glutes and driving your ankles up into your anchor

*Note*: You need to progress these by piking your hips less as they get easier to reach the next progression.

#### [**Advanced Harop Curl**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7ndeehIOhU)
 * Anchor your feet under something sturdy. You want to be anchored about a fist's distance away from your ankle.
 * Ascend by squeezing your glutes and driving your ankles up into your anchor

###Alternate Path 3:

# Equipment
Bands: [Recommended](https://www.performbetter.com/First-Place-Superbands). They're also available on Amazon if you search for "Perform Better Superbands". Their website has a good chart of each band's resistance, make sure to check that before you make your purchase. *Note*: You can "double up" your bands if they're big enough so you don't have to buy a 10kg resistance band and a 20kg resistance

Stick: Broom stick or PVC pipe or random stick doesn't matter. You can place this down your back during Romanian and Single Legged deadlifts to make sure you're keeping your back straight.

Barbell + Weights: If you want to progress with weighted Romanian or Single Legged Deadlifts

u/RockRaiders made a post with different setups for nordic curls [located here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/88cvqe/the_nordic_curl_the_ultimate_hamstring_bodyweight/). If you need more you can search the sub for setup threads [like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/910u5g/so_people_that_are_doing_new_rr_at_their_homes/).

# Frequently Asked Questions

##Why did you choose a banded approach to Nordic Curls?
We don't trust you to progress by manipulating leverages and staying consistent with the longer levers throughout each set so bands it is!

##How do I do the reps for single leg work?
5-8 Reps left leg, 5-8 reps right leg, then rest. Congratulations you finished a set.
