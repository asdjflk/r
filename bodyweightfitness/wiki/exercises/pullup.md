# Pull-up Progression


## General Form Cues

* Body slightly [hollow](/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/positioning) with straight legs throughout the whole exercise. Don't cross your legs.
* If you cannot get straight legs, it's preferable to keep the feet in front of the body rather than behind.
* Arms straight at the bottom. Don't think about anything else, just straight arms. The rest will happen automatically.
* Strive for chest to bar at the top. For this the forearms have to deviate from vertical, which may be a bit hard on the elbows, so build up to it slowly.
* Keep the neck in a neutral position: avoid craning it to get your chin over the bar
* It's natural for your legs to come forward: this keeps your centre of mass under the bar. Just make sure you're not violently swinging them upwards.

## Recommended Progression

### [**Scapular Pulls**](https://youtu.be/FgYoc4O-cio?t=1m21s)

 * Elbows should stay straight
 * Your back will arch more as you get stronger
 * These should be performed with a pause at the "top". Squeeze your shoulders, hold it for 3-5s then release into a dead hang *under control*
 * If you can't pull out of the dead hang at all, consider using bands or your feet to assist you until the gain the necessary strength.

### [**Arch Hangs**](https://youtu.be/C995b3KLXS4?t=7s)

 * Elbows should stay straight
 * Hold it for time/reps
 * [Start at this level](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoE-C85ZlCE)
 * Progress towards a 90 degree in your shoulder. Like [this](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/JusddCep6PA/hqdefault.jpg)

### [**Pull-up Negatives**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkpJkHpJXmM)  

 * Jump to the top of the pull-up position, then **slowly** (as slowly as you can), lower yourself until your arms are straight. Build up to **10sec negatives!**

### [**Pull-ups**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGo4IYlbE5g)  

 * See general form cues.


### **Weighted Pull-ups**
 * Like the fourth exercise in this progression, except with extra weight! [Here's](https://healthyforbetter.com/how-to-add-weight-to-pull-ups/) a list on different ways to add weight.


## Alternate Progression Path:

After you reach 3x8 Pull-Ups, you can choose one of these progressions if you don't want to do weighted Pull-Ups:

### Alternate Path 1:
#### [**L-sit Pull-ups**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeGS55RHBUU)  

 * Hold your legs in an [L-sit](/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/exercises/l-sit) position, perform a pull-up.

###Alternate Path 2:
####[**Arch Body Pull-ups**](https://i.imgur.com/y0k59F8.jpg)

###Alternate Path 3:
####[**Type-Writer Pull-up**](https://youtu.be/dvd5Fyl-Ves?t=15s)
 * Do a normal pullup, then pull yourself to each side at the top then descend normally. if you're doing these on rings then simply extend one arm at a time.
 * Your goal is to have a completely straight arm when you go to each side

####[**Archer Pull-ups**](https://youtu.be/vdjWgw98EeI?t=1m52s)
 * Assisting arm should be straight
 * You can place the assisting arm on the bar to make it easier

# Equipment
Okay, seriously, no excuses on this one. Tree branch, back of a staircase, bus stop... the opportunities for places to do pull-ups are endless. Besides, doorway pull-up bars are $20-40 a piece and will be a fantastic investment. If you still have no idea what to do, u/RockRaiders made a [post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/857cqj/no_idea_where_to_do_pullups_and_rows_here_are/) with many options. 

# Frequently Asked Questions
## **Should I do pull-ups or chinups?**
Either is fine. Chinups work more biceps, but that's as far as the significant differences go. Contrary to popular belief, chinups hit the lats very well, as much as pull-ups do.
