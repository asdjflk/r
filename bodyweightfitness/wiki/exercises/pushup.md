# Push-up Progression

## General Form Cues

* Body in a straight line from head to toe: don't let the hips sag!
* Lock out arms and protract the shoulderblades ([what does that even mean?](/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/positioning)) at the top
* Go down until chest nearly touches the ground
* Keep the elbows in, don't let them flare out
* Don't shrug up your shoulders to your ears, focus on depressing the shoulderblades ([what does that even mean?](/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/positioning)).

 * Standing next to a wall, put your hands on the wall and perform a pushup.

###[**Incline Pushup**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnfAYkBRDPY)  

 * Finding some raised object, put your hands on said object and perform a pushup. Lower the height to increase the difficulty.

 * See general form cues.

###[**Diamond Pushup**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0DnG1_S92I)  

 * Put your hands close together so the thumbs and index fingers touch, then perform a pushup.  

 * If this is too difficult or feels uncomfortable, put your hands just a bit closer than in a normal pushup. Work on moving the hands closer together over time until you reach diamond pushups.

###[**Pseudo Planche Pushups**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cdmg0CfMZeo)  

 * Putting your hands sideways, lean forward with a straight body until your shoulders are in front of your hands. Perform a pushup while maintaining forward lean. Protract the shoulderblades at the top.

 * Increase forward lean to make more difficult. Decrease forward lean to make easier. You won't run out of resistance anytime soon if you keep increasing your forward lean.


## Alternate Progression Path:

After your each 3x8 Diamond Pushups, you can choose one of these progressions if you don't want to do Pseudo Planche Pushups:
###Alternate Path 1: 

####[**Rings Pushup**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBviFvN3rHw)  

 * Perform a pushup on the rings. Turn out the rings at the top.

####[**RTO Pushup**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrlyEIpe0LI&t=2m55s)  

 * Starting from a plank position with the rings turned out, perform a pushup while keeping the rings turned out.  
 * This will feel alot like a pseudo planche pushup, but on rings.

* [**RTO PPPU**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kwe1EOiWMY)  

 * Starting from an RTO plank position, lean forward until your shoulders are in front of your hand. Perform a pushup while maintaining forward lean. Really protract and depress the shoulderblades at the top.
 * Increase forward lean to make it more difficult. Decrease forward lean to make it easier. You won't run out of resistance anytime soon if you keep increasing your forward lean.
