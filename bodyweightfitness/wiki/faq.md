## Routine Questions
### What routine should I do?

* **[The Recommended Routine](/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine)** is the routine that has historically been the 'one stop shop' routine for beginners since its inception in 2012! It's gone through various iterations and is great for beginners. If the RR seems like too much at first, there are [expert options to modify it](https://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/wiki/faq#wiki_the_recommended_routine_.28rr.29_is_too_much_for_me_as_a_beginner._what_can_i_do.3F).

* **[Minimalist Routine](https://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/wiki/minroutine)** if you are lacking time and just want to do something quick

* **[Move](https://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/wiki/move)** is a basic introductory routine to build up to exercise slowly as is the Primer below.

* [**The Primer Routine**](https://nick-e.com/exercise-library/routines/reddit-bwf-primer/) : A very gentle introduction to exercise ***(appropriate even for absolute beginners)*** that takes all the info and exercises you need to know to start across a **2 week learning period**, allowing you to start with *just one exercise* immediately on day one, and building up to a full body 3x/week strength routine comprised of just 6 exercises! You will graduate this program with the requisite strength to move right into the BWSF Routine linked below!

* [**The BWSF Routine**](https://nick-e.com/exercise-library/routines/bwsf/) : The Sequel to the Primer! This is the recommended training program for individuals that have completed the Primer and reached it's graduation requirements! (i.e You can do this program if you can do 3 sets of 8 pushups and horizontal rows with good form)

* Other routines can be found in our [Wiki Index](https://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/wiki/index/)

### The Recommended Routine (RR) is too much for me as a beginner. What can I do?

Some common modifications to the Recommended Routine include the following:

* Reducing the sets in the exercises to 1-2 instead of the full 3. This can help sedentary beginners or those for whom the RR volume is too much adapt into the routine much better
* Reduce the amount of days per week you do the routine. For example, going from 3x per week to 2x per week
* Splitting the RR into 2 separate routines like a 2 day split. For example, going to an "upper/lower split" where you have all of the upper body exercises on one day, and lower body + core on the other day. This can be done on a MWFSat for optimal rest distribution on a weekly schedule or MTuThF schedule if you like weekends free.
* If it's still a bit too much, and you're new, you can either remove the core triple or just pick one of the 1 push, 1 pull, and 1 legs exercise to start. For instance, squat progression, pushups progression, and rows progression. 

The set reduction method and increasing them over time if you need more is the preferred recommendation.

Alternatively, the [minimalist routine](https://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/wiki/minroutine) is similar to the last bullet point if you want to just do something without thinking about it.

### Who created the RR?

The Recommended Routine was originally the creation of 2 former mods, /u/161803398874989 and /u/m092 based largely off of the routine creation guide outlined in the first edition of /u/eshlow 's book 'Overcoming Gravity' with significant input from him. Over time, minor improvements were made to the routine, largely by these two mods. Some in response to community feedback, some independent of community feedback.

Eventually, in 2017, a major update to the RR was completed collaboratively by 3 former mods, /u/MrSylphie, /u/Captain_Nachos and /u/m092 (written roughly in order of magnitude of contribution). This update was not crowdsourced from the opinion of users, though the moderators experience of common complaints of the old version were an influencing factor in determining some of the changes made.

The routine has not been updated or changed in any major way since this update, nor likely will it.

### Is there an App or other resources to follow for the Recommended Routine?

Yes, there are several **FREE** ones. If you are being charged for any Recommended Routine app don't use it. We do not endorse monetization of the RR.

### I have no equipment to do pullups / rows / dips!

 * **Pull-ups**: Seriously, no excuses on this one. There are no alternatives to pullups, and they're very important, so buy a pullup bar, find a tree, or find a staircase with some space under it. You could also get rings and hang them from somewhere (there are many places if you look). One user even adapted the ["bedsheet" trick intended for rows... for pullups!]( https://youtu.be/wr8ZA-cvH3s ). [This thread](https://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/comments/857cqj/no_idea_where_to_do_pullups_and_rows_here_are/) by /u/RockRaiders goes over a lot of alternatives you can use. The options are limitless. 

 * **Rows**: You can do [incline rows using nothing but a bedsheet and closed door.]( https://youtu.be/wr8ZA-cvH3s )
* You can do them under a table as demonstrated in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYUxXMGVuuU), or you can put a raised object in front of your pullup bar and do rows from that.
* A stick across two chairs may work as well. 
* Or try hanging towels from your pullup bar.
* You could also get rings.
* There are a lot of ideas to be found in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/comments/28jm7r/technique_thursday_horizontal_rows_and_pulling/) and [this one](https://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/comments/857cqj/no_idea_where_to_do_pullups_and_rows_here_are/). Be creative.

 * **Dips**: A counter top which makes a 90 degree angle is suitable, as are the backs of two sturdy chairs, or two boxes next to eachother. Again, use your imagination.


### Is my routine good?

If you're doing [**Recommended Routine**](https://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine/)!), our answer will obviously be yes. However, if it isn't, here's a checklist, divided into two sections based on goals.

* Any good routine MUST have some form of progression. You can increase weights, increase reps and sets, go to harder progressions, and things like these. If you keep doing the same thing every week for months, you are not going to get stronger, bigger, more endurance, etc. 

**Splits**

Generally, we recommend full body routines for beginners and intermediates because you're doing an exercise at least 2-3x a week so you can improve on it each time that you do it. 2 day splits such as push/pull, upper/lower, or variants can work well. If you are 3 or more day splits like PPL or typical bro split like bis/back, chest/tris, legs, core then you're going to get low frequency with exercises which generally results in low progress. PPL in particular with no rest days PPLPPLR (R = rest) lacks rest days, so may have issues with fatigue. Hence, for beginners and intermediates generally full body or 2 day splits are the recommended form of routine structure.

**Strength, muscle mass or weight loss**

* *Not* a circuit (a circuit is when, for instance, you do set of pushups -> set of rows -> set of squats with little to no rest and repeat that circuit a bunch of times).
* A *majority* of the work is done in sets of 12 reps or less
 * Alongside this,  if you can do more than 3 sets of 8-12reps of an exercise it is recommended to move to a harder variation of the exercise to increase the intensity/force-required by moving to give the body the stimulus that it needs to get stronger. So if your routine doesn't have progression exercises and you are just doing things to failure, that's a huge red flag in itself.
* Balanced (There should not be major imbalances between total pushing and pulling work, particularly in horizontal pulling)
* Doesn't include high rep situps or crunches ([general justification](http://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/comments/16y4hp/the_faq_says_that_sit_ups_are_pointless_however/c80flk2)). Alternatives: V-ups, hanging leg raises, L-sits/V-sits, ab wheel, weighted planks. Weighted decline situps are solid for hypertrophy. Exceptions: your job requires them.
* No planche, front lever or back lever in the [skill work](http://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/wiki/training_guide#wiki_skill_work_and_strength_work) part of your workout

**Endurance**

* Volume in a constructive progressive overload manner is the best way to go (just do the exercise a whole lot since endurance is very exercise-specific).
* Doing tons and tons of reps per day or per workout such as 100+ pushups, pullups, squats and so on per day is a generally bad idea. [See this other FAQ entry for more details](https://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/wiki/faq#wiki_what_do_you_think_about_doing_100_pushups_a_day.3F)

**Rest days**

* Must have at least 2 or more full rest days where you are doing nothing or are only doing extremely light activity such as walking probably means it's bad if you are asking this question. Beginner full body routines 3x a week have 4 full rest days. 
* Remember, rest is when you recover and get stronger, bigger, more endurance, etc. No rest days means no recovery which means worse results and higher potential for overuse injuries. Rest is extremely important!

If your routine meets all these criteria, it's probably good. If it doesn't, it's bad.


### What's wrong with circuit training?
The short rests in a classical circuit (exercises one after the other with no rest in between exercises) result in less volume performed for the amount of fatigue they cause, making them less effective for hypertrophy. The low rest periods prevent full replenishment of ATP stores meaning you will not be able to work at high enough relative intensities to get a meaningful strength adaptation past the absolute beginner level, either.

For more, see these threads: [1](http://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/comments/2dfqkx/newbie_question_why_no_exercise_circuits/) [2](http://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/comments/22vnx2/why_are_circuits_bad/) [3](http://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/comments/2vural/why_shouldnt_a_workout_be_in_a_circuit/) [4](http://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/comments/27tvhh/what_is_wrong_with_speeding_up_a_routine_so_that/)

### How long should I rest between sets?
See this [concept Wednesday post](https://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/comments/2jzhmw/concept_wednesday_rest/).


### I'm going on vacation, how do I maintain my gains?
Unless you're going on vacation for like 2 months, enjoy your break. Your gains will still be there when they return. Otherwise, find ways to modify exercises to accommodate the equipment you'll have access to. If all else fails, strength and muscle are regained at a much faster rate than they're gained the first time round, so it's not the end of the world.


### What do you think about doing 100 pushups a day?

Or 100 pullups a day, or 1000 pushups in a month, or 100 burpees, or all other high rep variations of the same exercise. In all likelihood, you shouldn't. See [here](http://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/comments/2t18hi/to_everyone_doing_a_pushupsquatplankwhatever/).


### What about Bar Brothers / BarStarzz / Convict Conditioning / Freeletics / Insanity / P90X / THENX / etcetera?
See the [Program Review section](http://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/program_reviews) of our Wiki. If you can't find it there, see if it passes the checks in "Is my routine good?". If it does, consider posting to the sub.


### Can I train everyday?
That depends on your program. If you're training for strength or muscle mass, it's important to know that **you get stronger/bigger while you rest**, because of the supercompensation effect. See [training basics](/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/training_basics) for a detailed explanation. Training daily for strength/muscle mass is possible, but it's a more advanced technique and should be programmed correctly. If you're asking this question, it's very likely not for you.  
  
To see what you *can* do on your off days, see the question below.


### What can I do on my off days?

If you are on a strength program like our recommended routine, you need to rest on your off days in order to recover and get stronger. However, this doesn't mean that you have to sit on your ass all day. You can still do recreational physical activity like playing a pick-up game of basketball or going on a bike ride. **Walking** is most definitely fine as well. But more specific to bodyweight training you can do skill work like handstands and elbow levers, as well as mobility work (see "[How do I get flexible?](https://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_get_flexible.3F)"). 

These will help you improve your regular workouts. If you're planning on doing a certain sport or activity and are wondering if it will affect your recovery then you can search the sub for others experience as there's plenty of discussion on this available. Better yet, try it yourself and adjust your training as needed. Even something as intense as climbing can be combined with BWF if done right ([see here](https://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/comments/3sehab/concept_wednesday_combining_rock_climbing_with_bwf/)). **In regards to cardio, see the question below.**


### How do I combine cardio (running, swimming, cycling, rowing, etc.) with bodyweight training?

If you are strength training 3x a week, you can use some of your off days to do cardio. The typical schedule is to do cardio on off-days exclusively, so there's only one true rest day per week. However, a different schedule with more rest may be more optimal, for instance:

Day | Activity
---|---
Monday | BWF+Cardio
Tuesday | Rest
Wednesday | BWF+Cardio
Thursday | Rest
Friday | BWF  
Saturday | Cardio
Sunday | Rest 

With this schedule you get a couple more rest days per week, which may allow you to recover better. If you enjoy doing cardio on off days so you have something to do and can recover effectively from it, then there's nothing wrong with doing it that way either. 

In general, cardio should be done after strength training, not before. You should be fresh for your strength work, but still able to get in a good cardio workout.

If you are doing running/swimming/rowing/etc. competitively, you'll need to ask your coach or someone more knowledgeable (ie. the people at /r/running, /r/swimming and /r/rowing etc.) about what type of strength and conditioning is appropriate for you.

Note: HIIT, sprinting, or any other high intensity forms of cardio can negatively affect your recovery rates so that you may not be getting the best strength or hypertrophy workouts. So if you're not recovering as effectively with these types of workouts, you may have to decrease them or the RR and select which of these you prefer to work on the most as you cannot optimally do both.


### Should I do all sets of one exercise before moving onto the next exercise?
If you're doing the recommended routine, do it exactly as written. Complete each pair before moving onto the next pair.  
For any other programs, typically if you are looking for strength, muscle mass or weight loss, the answer to this question is yes.


### In the Recommended Routine, do I rest 90sec between EVERY exercise? How do I pair these exercises?

This is how it should be done:

First pair: Squats & Pull-Ups

    squats, rest 90sec, pull-ups, rest 90sec
    squats, rest 90sec, pull-ups, rest 90sec
    squats, rest 90sec, pull-ups, rest 90sec

Second pair Hinge & Dips

    hinge, rest 90sec, dips, rest 90sec
    hinge, rest 90sec, dips, rest 90sec
    hinge, rest 90sec, dips, rest 90sec

Third pair: Push-ups & Rows

    push-ups, rest 90sec, rows, rest 90sec
    push-ups, rest 90sec, rows, rest 90sec
    push-ups, rest 90sec, rows, rest 90sec

Core Triplet 

    anti-extension, rest 60sec, anti-rotation, rest 60sec, extension, rest 60sec
    anti-extension, rest 60sec, anti-rotation, rest 60sec, extension, rest 60sec
    anti-extension, rest 60sec, anti-rotation, rest 60sec, extension, 5ever/until next workout day



###How do I do the reps for unilateral (one sided) work?
5-8 Reps left side, 5-8 reps right side, then rest. Congratulations you finished a set.


### Can I split my routine up over the day?

This is fine to do for the Recommend Routine or any other routine. Since its the same volume and intensity there are no issues with overuse injuries.

* For strength, this isn't a problem, but you have to warmup every time you start a new block which may take excessive time.
* For hypertrophy, you may lose some stimulus for muscle growth, but if you can't fit it in otherwise, you'll have to.
* Some prefer splitting the routine into upper and lower + core components and even doing them different days which is an option too


### I want to move onto a split routine, should I?

[Read this post](https://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/comments/6talge/split_routines_tend_to_be_suboptimal_for_beginners/) by /u/eshlow on why split routines tend to be suboptimal for beginners.


### I usually train with barbells/dumbbells, how do I integrate that with bodyweight training?
Read [this article](http://stevenlow.org/integrating-bodyweight-and-barbell-training/). The gist of it is you start with a good barbell or bodyweight only program, and then substitute similar lifts, e.g. front lever for rows.


### How do I increase my pushup/situp/pullup numbers?
People trying to get into the marines/army/whatever often need to perform high rep bodyweight movements for time, ie. doing as many pushups as possible in two minutes. You don't need to train for this year round: endurance is something that is gained fairly quickly. We recommend you do some type of strength training in your "off-season". This will enhance your capacity for endurance while also giving you the benefits of a strength training in general. Start test-specific training a few weeks out from the test.  
A solid protocol for increasing pushup/situp/whatever numbers is grease the groove. Do 50-70% of your max reps 3-5 times a day 3-5 times a week with at least an hour between sets. Then you rest a couple days before the test (3-4 days should be good) and then do the test. Good luck!

### How do I "grease the groove"?

Generally speaking, it's strongly not recommended for a vast majority of trainees.

To explain why, let's preface with an explanation of what it is. Grease the Groove (GtG) is a technique where, instead of doing all sets and reps of an exercise in a single workout, you do submaximal sets of that exercise throughout the day. It is commonly advertised to be useful in increasing the amount of reps you can do in a single exercise.

The gist of GtG is instead of doing exercises the conventional way (sets of reps in a workout with other exercises, in a whole routine), you do many, many submaximal sets of a just a single exercise throughout the day to accumulate a lot of volume with minimal fatigue. This can be a very effective protocol for simply increasing reps on an exercise you can already perform for at least 6 reps with good form, but it has too many pitfalls to be a readily recommended training modality.

The tricky part of GtG is it is fundamentally incompatible with a normal structured training program. It can very easily mess with your recovery when done on non-training days, and be very hard to fit in/around training days. Not to mention having to modify your training to accommodate for the massive amount of volume you'll be doing on that one exercise. 

Therefore, it's only really useful if the single movement you are GtG-ing is the *only* thing you train (which is strongly not advised for any length of time other than the short term, measured in the range of a few weeks.)

In summary, don't go looking to make this a mainstay of your training, but if you are an ***experienced trainee with a good history of balanced training*** and want to try it out for a couple of weeks max, then give it a shot. 

**Word of caution on recovery and injuries**: If your recovery starts to decrease and you're feeling overly fatigued or if you start to feel overuse injuries coming on such as sore connective tissues, tendons, joints, and other body parts then it's possible that you this is too much frequency and volume for you and not a good progression method. 

Here are some pointers:

* Do a max reps test of the exercise you want to do. It's recommended to be able to do atleast 6 reps of an exercise with good form before you GtG it.

* Take half of whatever your max reps is, and that is your new starting point. If your max was 6, now do 3.

* You can either do it ad hoc 'whenever I walk past a certain spot in my house', or if you want to systematise it more, then pick an interval ideally no less than every 30 minutes for your sets. If you have short intervals (closer to 30 minutes than 2 hours) then pick a limited amount of time to do this for so you don't end up doing 30 sets of the exercise a day.

* You can GtG with multiple exercises if you wish, but that can easily get very, very out of hand and you can pile on an excessive amount of volume that way. Doing more than 2 exercises concurrently is not recommended.

### How do I get flexible?

You can find a basic beginner program for stretching [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20200203024733/https://phrakture.github.io/starting-stretching.html), which is accompanied by the program [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20200920203207/https://phrakture.github.io/molding-mobility.html). It will cover most bases and go well with our recommended routine.

Another good resource is [Kit Laughlin's work](https://www.youtube.com/user/KitLaughlin). You can find his AMA [here](/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/comments/2bcaby/kit_laughlin_here_creator_of_stretch_therapy_and/).

Check out /r/flexibility and the [flexibility friday archive](/r/flexibility/comments/19he16/i_thought_you_guys_may_like_this/) for more info.


### What is a good morning routine to do daily?
Depends on your goals. If you want to get stronger/bigger, lose weight, go to "What routine should I do?". If your only goal is to get active in the morning, try out [molding mobility](https://phrakture.github.io/molding-mobility.html), maybe do some [cat-cows](http://www.reddit.com/r/yoga/comments/2hw6kp/i_do_catcow_every_morning_before_getting_on_the/) or [scapular shrugs](http://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/comments/2d5n5i/my_newest_video_is_on_how_to_do_scapular_shrugs/). You could also play around with the bodyline work.

The point here is that it doesn't really matter as long as it gets you up and moving. Mobility work is great for this. If you're looking for a workout, go do an actual workout.


### I can't use my wrist/shoulder/ankle/[insert bodypart], what now?
Talk to your doctor about this. Unless you have their clearance to exercise, we will not help you.


### How many calories does my routine burn?
We don't recommend tracking your calories burned through exercise explicitly. Instead, let the multiplier in your TDEE calculation take care of it (see the Diet section).



## Diet
### Where can I find answers to my questions about diet?

We built an article about nutrition in terms of gaining, losing or maintaining called [Nutritional Phases](https://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/about/wiki/nutrition_phases/) it gives you a guide on when to choose to bulk, cut or maintain and what these terms even mean.

We discussed diet in our [Theory Thursday threads](https://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/wiki/weekly/conceptwednesday#wiki_diet) which can give you some insights. 

You can also find answers to most of your diet questions in the [/r/fitness FAQ](https://thefitness.wiki/improving-your-diet/). 

Last but not least there are some great diet specific subreddits with great FAQs, specially [/r/loseit FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/wiki/faq) and [/r/gainit FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/wiki/index).

## Results/Limits
### What kind of results can I expect from bodyweight training?

Bodyweight training is just resistance training. If your diet and training is right, you can expect to gain muscle, or lose fat, and get stronger. You can also build a nice body with bodyweight training. 

There is a definite ceiling to how far you can progress before you move on to either needing more equipment/weights, and/or more advanced gymnastics work that shifts the bias off of simple muscle hypertrophy and strength to skill and connective tissue conditioning.

However, the good news is, the fit, athletic look that most people will be going for is definitely achievable with bodyweight training

The most significant limitation of bodyweight exercise is that weight training works much better for legs.

We have [Monthly BWF Physique](https://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/search?q=Monthly+BWF+Physique+Thread+for&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) threads for some real life examples. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/comments/2wpw9r/what_does_someone_who_has_only_used_bodyweight/) is another thread with some more pictures from subreddit members.  [Here](https://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/comments/3hhmk3/people_of_rbodyweightfitness_what_do_you_look_like/) is another one.

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/comments/37vvdm/progress_ive_been_doing_the_recommended_routine/) is a larger progress post, courtesy of /u/ImChrisBrown.


### What are my limits if I'm tall?
For taller guys, the levers (front lever, back lever, planche) are going to be significantly harder, but especially front and back levers are not unattainable. The only way to find out where your limits lie is to work hard and really look for them.

We've had a couple threads on the subject: [here](http://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/comments/1qow0x/are_levers_attainable_for_2_meter_tall_guy/), [here](http://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/comments/10qdxj/any_tall_guys_with_advanced_isometrics_here/), [here](http://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/comments/1wdhld/how_much_harder_is_it_for_a_someone_thats_190cm/), [here](http://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/comments/23jb0d/is_65_too_tall_to_do_full_planche/).

### How soon will I see results?
If your routine is good, you'll see progress in the exercises themselves about 2-3 workouts in.

If your diet is in check, you'll notice physique changes 4-6 weeks, but it'll take 12+ weeks for it to be really noticable to others.

## Equipment

### What gloves should I get?
If you have issues with your hands when gripping the bar, this is more likely to be caused by gripping the bar incorrectly. Watch [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTqNSgCmM2s) to see how it's done (it's shown on a barbell but the same principle holds for the bar). We don't recommend using gloves because they reduce the amount of grip you have on the bar.


### What rings should I get?
The consensus is that wooden rings feel nicer than either plastic or metal. The downside is that you can't just leave them hanging outside. The main difference between $25 and $35 wooden rings are the strap length. They vary from 14 to 16 feet. Get the longest one you can afford.


### What resistance band should I get?
Resistance bands come in several degrees of resistance, we can usually divide them in light, medium, and heavy resistance bands. For the purpose of warming up (such as the resistance band warmup exercises from the Recommended Routine) a light band will be optimal. For the purpose of assistance (such as assisted pullups) a medium band will give you greater assistance. If you want to purchase a band for only one of these two purposes, then choose the corresponding resistance. If you plan on using your band for both purposes, consider buying both resistances. A heavy band will rarely ever be needed, so if you want one for a particular reason, make sure to get another resistance as well as it is the one you will use the most for its versatility.


### How do I set up/maintain my rings?
We have compiled a list of threads with different ways of setting up and maintaining your rings [here](https://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/wiki/diy#wiki_all_about_rings). 


### What pullup bar should I get?
The [doorframe-supported style pull-up bar](https://imgur.com/A65ZyZJ) is the most popular choice by far. [Put $COLOUR socks on the ends](https://imgur.com/PFeaHd4) to avoid $COLOUR door frame stains.

If you have wider doorways, or weak doorframes, the [extendable pull-up bar variant](https://i.imgur.com/alzWXOI.jpg) may be a better option.

If you are worried a pullup bar, or your doorframes will not hold you weight, you should look into getting a [power rack/pull-up tower](https://imgur.com/T92GeH6). 


### How can I best add weight to exercise X?
The most convenient way of adding weight to an exercise is using a dip belt. A backpack also works in the beginning, but with very heavy dips/pullups it's a bit riskier

If you want to buy a weight vest, the vest needs to not be massively oversized (meaning the load would ideally be metal rather than sand), the shoulder straps need to be narrow enough to allow overhead motion for pullups, there should be a chest strap to keep it in place, and it should go heavy enough that it will actually be a useful investment for a long enough time. Some vests go up to 30kg if you can find them, but 20kg is the heaviest you will *usually* find. 

A 10-15lbs non-incremental sand vest is not gonna cut it, and is very much going to be a waste of money.

If none of the above are available to you, [here is a DIY way of loading weight to your movement.](https://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/comments/fp8eec/diy_push_up_harness_and_loading_pin/)


### What about TRX/Suspension training?
If you want to buy some equipment, get rings instead. Rings allow you to get on top, so you can do muscle ups, support holds, and all kinds of good stuff. Furthermore, the stabilization on a TRX can be a bit wonky, and you can't really vary the width. And, of course, rings tend to be cheaper.


## Specific Exercise Questions
### My legs hurt/cramp when I do L-sit!/Leg Raises/My straight leg hurts/cramps when I do pistol squats!
This is normal and common. It's cause you're weak in that position. Keep working it, massage it and it'll go away with time. Additional [compression work](https://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/wiki/exercises/l-sit#wiki_compression_work) in your mobility routine helps as well.


### I can't keep my legs together on tuck L-sit!
This is very common. As long as you're not resting your legs on your arms, this is fine. Over time you'll have to extend your legs and then you'll be able to keep them together.


### I can't L-sit on the floor, but I can on my fists/paralettes/etc. What gives?
You're just weak. The floor L-sit requires better compression (closing the angle between the torso and the hips) and better scapular depression (pushing the shoulders down) than its paralette counterpart. Keep working on it, and it'll be yours.


### My head feels like it's going to explode on handstands!
Keep working, it'll go away with time. No, you're not going to die. [Here](http://chrissalvato.com/2013/08/handstand-exploding-head-syndrome/)'s a more in-depth article.


### Are handstands necessary?
While handstands are not strictly necessary, at least not in the beginning, they have so many benefits that they are absolutely worth your time. If you want to drop handstands for any other reason than injury, we strongly urge you to reconsider. Below is some elaboration on the benefits.

First off, the handstand is a position you can move in and out of to do harder exercises, like handstand pushups or handstand presses. There's a similar relation between support holds and things like dips and muscle ups. Being able to do handstands unlocks higher level skills you will need later in order to grow bigger and/or stronger.  
Secondly, the handstand develops body awareness and coordination, and it also requires strong and flexible wrists and shoulders. It has many benefits in and of itself.
Finally, handstands are just a cool skill to obtain. People think they are awesome, they feel awesome to do... And they are awesome. What's not to like?


### Why do stomach-to-wall handstand?
Stomach-to-wall handstands force you to have better posture (straighter line) when doing the handstand, which in turn will make the handstand much easier. This is good because the handstand is a position to start or end more difficult movements like handstand pushups and handstand presses in, so you want it to be easy.


### I can't balance while in a handstand!
You're likely missing the most central point in a handstand, which is that *balancing is a series of corrections rather than a static position*. There are two ways you can lose a handstand: in the direction of the fingers, which is called overbalancing, and in the opposite direction, which is called underbalancing. In a handstand you continuously go from slightly overbalanced to slightly underbalanced, to slightly overbalanced, etc. The balancing action comes from the fingers initially, and preferably *only* from the fingers.

To correct overbalancing, you need to press the fingers into to the floor. You'll want to do [heel pulls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYehg2ruMN0) in order to really get a handle on it.

[Toe pulls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9-7QXCsPL0) will help with underbalancing. The initial correction is simply to lift the fingers a bit. If that doesn't correct it enough, you break the line to get your hips forward.

Learning to master the balance of a handstand without compensating through the shoulders/hips and the like can take a long time. Don't get discouraged if at first you don't get it, it's simply part of the process.


### I can't keep my feet flat when I squat!
This is caused by a lack of ankle flexibility. Work on that, as well as general squatting. Searching /r/flexibility will yield some threads that are useful.


### Can I replace rows by pullups?
No. Rows work the mid-back more effectively, which is important for shoulder health.


### Do I really need leg exercises? I already cycle/row/play soccer/run/etc.
Yes, you really need leg exercises. They will make you better at Cycling/rowing/soccer/running. 


### I get chest/sternum pain when doing dips/support holds. How can I fix this?
This is caused by both loading and stretching the tendons of the chest, which they are not used to at first. There are a couple things you could have to work on.

Before doing anything else, make sure you are proficient in diamond pushups. If you can't do those, you have no business attempting dips. If you can do diamond pushups well, still take it easy on the dips, but not stop doing them completely. A little pulling sensation in the chest is fine, but if it starts hurting, back off. Over time you'll find you can do more. Two other things to watch out for are form and ROM. Retracting the shoulderblades at the bottom of a dip is going to put a lot more stress on the chest. Keeping them more neutral is probably helpful. Likewise, you can reduce the ROM to make the exercise a bit easier. It'll also stretch your chest less.

As always, **if you get pain, back off**. If your pain is chronic (also affecting other exercises and daily life), please see a medical professional.


### My wrists hurt during pushups/handstands/L-sits/etc. What now?

**[Read this post by /u/antranik if you haven't already.](https://redd.it/4xjd5o)**

Some of the tips mentioned in that thread include:

* In a lot of cases, this is caused by not distributing the weights on the hands correctly. In [this image](https://i.imgur.com/EKrcH6z.jpg), the weight should be on the green parts.

* Sometimes your wrists have to adapt a bit in order to take the complete load during these exercises. Make sure you're doing [wrist prep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSZWSQSSEjE) which will make your wrists stronger and more mobile. On top of that, keep using your wrists! If you get sharp pain or more than a little bit of soreness, back off, but if you never use your wrists they're never going to adapt. If you still need to do a couple sets, [do them on your fists or using pushup bars.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ua7B2q21UHg)

* If you have pre-existing wrist issues like cysts or RSI, talk to a medical professional about this.


### The rings painfully dig into my forearms on support holds/pushups. What should I do?
You're likely consciously or unconsciously leaning on the rings.

1. Make sure you hang your rings far enough apart. The distance from tip of the middle finger to point of the elbow is about the minimum.
2. If the rings are still digging in, play around with the wrist and forearm position. You want to tilt the wrist such that the the forearms are clear of the rings. The rings should hang straight down.
3. If you can't maintain this position during the exercise, the exercise you're doing currently is too hard for you.


### I don't feel my X when doing Y, what's wrong?
Most likely nothing. Beginners often get the idea that they need to "feel the burn" or "feel it in the muscles" whereas in most cases they are better off just focussing on performing the exercise correctly, which will target the right muscles with the right stimulus anyway.


### What are some good exercises for X muscle/muscle group/bodypart?
If you have to ask this question, you're likely nowhere near advanced enough to worry about training specific muscles. Thinking about movements in your training is more effective, and you'll learn as you go. See [this post](http://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/comments/1hb1bd/on_movements_and_muscles/) for more details.

If you're still hell-bent on finding exercises, please review the [exercise wiki](https://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/wiki/playground), and search the subreddit.


### My X hurts when I do Y!
Check your form ([form check fridays](https://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/search?q=form+check+friday+author%3Am092+OR+author%3Aautomoderator&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all) or in the [Daily Questions Thread](https://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/search?q=BWF+Daily+Discussion+and+Beginner%2FRR+Questions+Thread+for&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all)). If it's bad, fix it. If that fixes it, great!  
Otherwise, back off and rest it for a week. Doing non-painful stuff is alright (it's only a short time, don't worry about imbalances). After your rest, work back up slowly.  
If your pain still isn't gone, see a medical professional as this is something that should be assessed by a professional. Do not post to the sub as that violates rule 2. 


### My pullup bar is too low for me to hang from it with straight legs? What do I do?
Bend your legs. You can either bend at the hips and keep the legs straight, go into a tuck-L position (as if you were sitting on a chair), or only bend at the knees. The hip and tuck-L positions will be a little harder because your center of gravity changes.

During the exercise, keep your body shape: if the legs are straight, they stay straight, and if they're bent, they stay bent. Hip angle can change a bit if you have straight legs, but not when you do the tuck-L position.

NO ADVERTISING.**

### How do I improve my posture?
[Poor posture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poor_posture#Risks) can lead to many health issues and chronic pains. Posture is also important in our exercises. If you have good posture to begin with, you don't need to spend much thought on assuming the proper positions for exercises as that will come naturally.  
The main thing to note is that **posture is a habit**. You can do all the hip flexor stretches, pectoralis minor stretches, glute/back activation drills you want, but if you're not working on actually standing up straight, it's no use. Exercise is no more than a supplement to this process.

### I'm sore in different places, what does this mean? I'm sore, should I workout?

**What if I'm feeling an exercise only in this specific muscle group falls here too**

Generally, it is fine to workout when sore, but it sometimes can impede your workouts. Delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) typically results from doing new exercises, exercises with lots of range of motion in eccentric or slow eccentric components, or doing a large volume and intensity of exercise that you're not used to. Soreness (DOMS) means very little (unless you can't move a bodypart at all, in which case you should see a doctor). 

If the soreness feels like too much you can warm up and see how you feel and then workout if it improves. If it feels like too much you can have a half workout or wait another day. Generally, if it's too much and you're having consistent issues with this you need to cut back on the volume of exercises in your workout until it goes away completely. For instance, if you started with the Recommend Routine which has 2 exercises for 3 sets for muscle groups:

* You may need to drop down to 1-2 sets for your exercises to start over the first week or two, 
* Then build fully to 2 sets over another week or two, 
* Finally, add the extra sets to build into the full volume of 3 sets. 

This will reduce soreness. Also, you do not need to be sore to progress.

You may also feel "the burn," soreness, or feel muscles working in areas that you weren't expecting. This doesn't mean much. It could be that your muscles aren't used to a certain exercise. It could mean that is the muscle that is working a bit harder and is stronger. It could mean that that muscle is working because it was a bit weaker than the others ones. It does not mean that your muscles are not working for the muscle groups you were trying to hit with the exercise. There are usually only 2 times this matters:

* The main time this matters is if you've been training for several years and if the muscle(s) are smaller and less strong than the others then you may have a weak link that needs some isolation work.

* The other exception is if your form is bad and it's affecting other area(s) of the body. So check your form by videoing yourself if you're worried.

### I'm not sore, is this working?

This is the same question as "not feeling an exercise" when you're doing it when feeling it in other muscles or feeling the burn in other muscles. 

You do not have to feel tired, sore, fatigued or feel your muscles burning or any other things like that after performing a training program or during an exercise. A routine may or may not make you feel any of these ways. The best way to track your progress is through measurements. Make sure your abilities are increasing such as strength, sets, repetitions, and progressions. If your goal is to gain muscle mass, take progress pics and scale measurements. If your goal is endurance, track your times and reps. Also, keeping a training log with data can also be really good. 

It's common for people to assume they need to be sore to feel like they're getting stronger, but it's not true, once you get used to an exercise, it doesn't cause soreness. When you take an extended break and go back to it, it will feel sore temporarily again, but it will dissipate with practice again.  Soreness doesn't have to be present for progress (increase in reps/load) to occur.

* For beginners, just getting stronger at squats, pullups, dips, rows, and pushups will make ALL of your muscles get bigger and stronger.
* The only time this really matters is usually at intermediate-advanced level. If you are not feeling an exercise AND if your muscles are undersized compared to the other muscles working then there may be an issue there. 

One new theory coming out is that DOMS may be caused by [neural microdamage](https://www.reddit.com/r/overcominggravity/comments/ke3fjz/new_theory_doms_is_most_likely_neural_microdamage/) which is why soreness does not necessarily related to increased strength and hypertrophy. The neural microdamage to the sensory fibers does not affect the gain of neurological adaptations for strength or the mechanisms of hypertrophy (mechanical tension, muscle damage, metabolic stress). 


### I can do X pushups and only Y pullups, am I imbalanced?
If you have to ask the question, you are very likely not imbalanced. Any imbalance you might have will even out with consistent training using proper form.  
There is no certain amount of pushups you have to be able to do for every pullup, or anything like that. Just train your whole body and you should be fine.


### My right/left side is stronger/bigger than my left/right side. What do I do?

**This covers all questions related to imbalances in the body**

If you are still unsure about any type of potential self correction see a sports physical therapist to help you.

For most people, their right arm is going to be stronger than their left, or vice versa, and this is not a problem per se. Just focus on having good form for the exercises, using both limbs equally. Things will generally even out over time. 

If this does not even out over time and the the imbalance is too pronounced, that is problematic because exercising will only make the imbalance more pronounced. To correct this type of severe imbalance, some type of unilateral (one-limbed) exercise like isolation exercises or compound exercises such as one-arm pushups, archer pullups and the like are useful. It's also important to pay close attention to form on exercises and make sure each limb is making the same motion.

Also, when you're doing unilateral exercises, start your sets with your weaker side to prioritize it.

### My joints pop/crack/click/snap. Is this bad?
As a general rule, if it's not painful it's probably not an issue. If you're still worried, ask your doctor. Read [this article](http://stevenlow.org/cracking-and-popping-and-clicking-oh-my/) for details.


### What does X term / abbreviation mean?
Check our [glossary](https://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/glossary).


### Do you have any book recommendations?
Here are a couple threads on the subject: [1](https://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/comments/3fat5c/book_recommendations/), [2](https://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/comments/1ywsir/recommend_any_good_books/), [3](https://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/comments/174iaq/good_books_for_a_beginner/), [4](https://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/comments/2cccw9/are_there_any_good_books_on_bodyweight_fitness/), [5](https://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/comments/239mto/what_are_the_best_books_available_on_bodyweight/), [6](https://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/comments/37iyld/any_good_books_to_buy_for_bodyweight_workouts/), [7](https://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/comments/2639uo/suggestions_for_book_references/).


### I heard something about breadloaf abs! Should I be worried?
No. "[Breadloaf Abs](http://www.alignforhealth.com/uploads/1/0/3/5/10350371/6991240_orig.jpg)" are common "issue" that many people run into caused by improper core activation. It is really not a big deal and is easily fixed by learning how to properly brace your core.

To do so just imagine you're about to get punched in the gut and tighten up your core. Your core will tighten up and draw everything in. Focus on doing this whenever you are working your abs and soon it will become instinctive.

There is no need to do stomach vacuums or any other isolation work. However, You will always see some bulging of the abdominals since they are contracting but that is normal. The important part is that you are activating your core as a whole.


### If I gain weight while doing bodyweight fitness, will the exercises get easier or harder?
It depends on how much weight you're gaining. 

If it's a small amount of weight, say a pound (~0.5 kg) a week, the effect will be very small as to be almost unnoticable. However, you may have some more trouble adding reps because you're (very slightly) heavier. If you're gaining over 2 lbs (~1 kg) a week, it's definitely going to be noticeable and your exercises will get harder. This doesn't mean you're losing absolute strength, but you are losing relative strength.    
For a more in-depth take on weight, strength and how they relate to each other [see here](https://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/comments/5vj39w/concept_wednesday_relative_strength/).


### I feel pain in my joints/I think I have tendonitis, what should I do?
[This isn't the place to be seeking medical advice per the rules (no medical advice).](https://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/wiki/rules#wiki_2._no_medical_advice.) However, questions about tendonitis pop up often and since the internet is full of bad advice on the subject, we think the best approach is to try and provide some solid information than leave people at their own devices about this: A [well-researched article on tendonitis](http://stevenlow.org/overcoming-tendonitis/). Here are the [search results for tendonitis.](https://www.reddit.com/recommended-routine/bodyweightfitness/search?q=tendonitis&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all) Read all these threads and refrain from posting new ones because the topic has been discussed extensively before. Also, we **strongly** encourage you to see a qualified professional such as a medical doctor and sports oriented physiotherapist. If you do choose to not see a doctor then rest and hope it heals properly. **DO IT AT YOUR OWN RISK**.
