# Positioning
This page will help you understand what we mean when we talk about "protraction" and "depression", what "turning the rings out" means, what a "hollow hold" is and various other phrases to do with body positioning or form.

## Scapular protraction, retraction, depression, elevation
These are all terms referring to the scapulae, or the shoulderblades as they're more commonly known. The shoulderblades are tremendously important for good shoulder function, and understanding these terms will help you maintain the best form possible on various exercises.

Protraction and retraction (or abduction and adduction, respectively) are opposites. In protraction, the scapulae move forward and outwards from eachother, while in retraction, the scapulae move backwards and towards eachother.  
You protract by pushing your shoulders forward, trying to touch them in front of your chest. Retracting is done by squeezing the shoulderblades together.

Protraction is mainly important during planche work, while retracting is important in rows and other forms of horizontal pulling.

[**Depression and elevation**](http://breddydotorg.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/shoulder-scapular-motions.jpg)  
Depressing the scapulae means you're moving them down towards your butt, like in a support hold. Elevation is the opposite, where the shoulderblades move up towards your head.  
You depress by pushing your shoulders down, trying to get your arms as low as they can go. You elevate by pushing your shoulders up, as if you're trying to cover your ears.

Depression is important during dipping, support holds, and L-sits. It's also important to do during horizontal pulling and pushing (to prevent shrugging up). Elevation is mainly important during handstand-related exercises.

The scapulae can do more than just protracting, retracting, elevating and depressing (upward rotation, downwards rotation, anterior tipping, posterior tipping)

Often you'll hear these two things being combined: for instance, in a planche you want to both protract and depress. In that case, you may be able to protract more if you let your depression go, but the focus should be on doing both, not one or the other.

## Hollow, arch

[**Arch**](https://i.imgur.com/JboKv4O.jpg)  
Hollow/arched refers to the position of the spine/pelvis. When you're hollow, the lower back is flat (normally it's slightly arched) and your pelvis is posteriorly rotated (think end position of a hip thrust). When you're arched, it's the exact opposite. There is a curve in your lower back and your pelvis is anteriorly rotated (your butt is sticking out).  
The trick in getting in a hollow position is to squeeze your butt while pulling your belly button to your spine. It may be helpful to think about doing a hip thrust to get your hips in the right position, and then pull in your belly button. In order to end up at an arch, stick out your butt and extend your spine as far as it goes.  
Both of these are best done on the ground at first.

## Rings Turned Out

Turning the rings out refers to the position of your arms when on the rings. You have turned the rings out when your thumbs are facing to the side, away from you. It may be helpful to think of screwing your shoulders into their sockets.  
At first RTO will be unstable, but as you practice it more, it'll get better. RTO is anatomically a more stable position than rings parallel or rings turned in.

## Pike and Straddle

[**Straddle**](http://i.imgur.com/V0N6i.jpg)    
Those terms are about the relative positioning of the legs and the hips. In the pike position the legs are kept together and the hips are flexed. In the straddle position the legs are open and the hips may or not be flexed. That's it.
