# Welcome to the Skill Day Routine

* **This routine will cover the following goals:**

 * Skills
 * Mobility

* **Overall Structure of this Routine:**

 * **Warm Up**
       * Dynamic stretches


 * **Skill Work**
     * Handstand progressions
     * L-sit

 * **Your choice of mobility**


## Weekly Schedule

* Do this 2-3x a week

* So you could do it Monday, Wednesday, Friday. Or Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday. Or Wednesday, Friday, Sunday. Whatever fits your schedule.


## How Progressions Work

* Progression exercises are there to help you be able to do exercises you cannot currently do because they are too difficult (for example, if you cannot do a push-up, you will be doing wall push-ups or incline push-ups).

* Some of the exercises are static holds, such as the L-sit progressions. Instead of dynamic reps, one set here consists of simply holding the position statically for 10-30 seconds. Move on to the next harder progression once you hit 30 seconds.

# Workout Begins Here:

### Warm-up: Dynamic Stretches (5-10min)


|  Reps  | Exercise | Comments |
|:--------|-----------|-------------:|
| 10 |[Trap-3 Raise](https://i2.wp.com/www.nick-e.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-12-31-19.36.45.jpg) | Hinge forward. Shoulder Depressed and Retracted. Raise arm about 15 degrees overhead, maintaining shoulder position.  |
| 10 |[External Rotation](https://i0.wp.com/www.nick-e.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-12-31-19.21.12.jpg) | Shoulders Depressed and Retracted. If you can’t feel it, don’t up the weight because it must be ‘too easy’ |
| 10 |[Serratus Wall Slides](https://i2.wp.com/www.nick-e.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2017-12-31-20.23.51.jpg)| Arms pointing slightly out from "straight up". Protract hard then slide your arms up the wall. |

| 10+ | [GMB Wrist Prep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mSZWSQSSEjE) | Do as many reps as you want|


* It also important to note that the warm-up can and should be modified if you have particular 'problem areas' or 'tight areas' that may need special attention. 

### Skill work (10 minutes)

**Instructions:** Set a timer for 5-10 minutes and go practice your L-sits and handstand, *resting as necessary.* When time's up, move to the mobility work.

# Frequently Asked Questions

## How can I combine this with a strength routine?

Add the "warmup" into your warmup, place the Skill Work before the strength stuff, and put mobility after strength or later/earlier in the day.

## What kind of movements can I add to this?

These skills are all about low-impact exercises. Front Lever, Back Lever, Planche, Manna, Human Flag, Dragon Flag are all skills but they are **strength** skills. They don't belong here. Most handbalancing (handstand, handstand shapes, crow pose etc...) can fit here. If you have a good base of mobility and strength you can do some of the easier animal walks (bear crawl, monkey walks, frog jumps).
