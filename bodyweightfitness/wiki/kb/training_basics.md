# Stress, recovery and adaptation
In this section, you will learn the basics of how the body gets better at doing stuff and will learn the basis for understanding why we program workouts the way we do. First we'll talk about the SAID principle and how it applies to working out. Then we'll go over how your body adapts, as well as the variables intensity, volume, frequency and workload and how they interrelate. We'll end the section with a look at a few workout protocols to see how these principles apply in practice.

## The SAID principle
SAID stands for "Specificity of Adaptation to Imposed Demands". In simple terms, it says that **you get better at what you do**. Your workout or practice time should be spent doing the very thing you want to improve and your body will learn that this is what you want it to do, and provide the necessary changes to make this possible.

This principle is very important in creating workouts. If you want to gain strength (i.e. improve the maximal load you can handle for at least 1 rep), you should be working in low rep ranges (<8) rather than high rep ranges (>12) because lower rep ranges are closer to a one repetition maximum (1RM). As for the question: "then why isn't strength training all 1RMs?", read on for a bit, we'll get to that in the section on intensity, volume and frequency.  
Likewise, if you want to gain absolute endurance (ie. improve the number of reps you can do at a given load), you should be working in high rep ranges, because low rep ranges don't look like an endurance activity at all!

So keep in mind: **you get better at what you do**. Below are some examples of how to apply the SAID principle:

* If your goal is to get better at bench pressing and only bench pressing, the bulk of your work should be focused on bench pressing. You could also do push-ups instead, which are similar, but if you do those your body will get better specifically at push-ups and only get better at bench pressing by proxy.
* Not only specific exercise, but specific training parameters are important too. Weighted dips with a load suitable for 5 reps will transfer better to your bench press at 5 reps than doing weighted dips with a load suitable for 20 reps.
* If you want to learn how to hold a handstand, you should be spending a lot of time on your hands, and focusing less time on other drills to improve your handstand.
* If you want to get better at playing an instrument, you're going to have to spend a lot of time at the instrument. You can learn theory and train your ear all you want, but if you don't actually play on the instrument, you're not going to learn it well.

Note that (as with so many things), the SAID principle isn't the be-all-end-all of things. Sometimes, your progress on things like the bench press may get stuck because of a weak link somewhere, or because you're becoming an intermediate (for what we define as intermediate, see the section bellow), in which case the problem may not be resolved by simply bench pressing.

## Fatigue, Fitness and Supercompensation
To talk about supercompensation and recovery models, we'll first need to define fitness and fatigue.

We define **"fitness"** as generally any and all capabilities you have, and more specific the capability you're trying to improve. So if you're trying to get stronger, "fitness" means your strength level, and if you're trying to gain endurance, "fitness" means the number of reps you can do.

If you work out, you probably already have experienced it: after a workout, you lose some of your capabilities. If you did pushups in your workout, then your ability to do pushups after the workout is going to be less. This is what we call **"fatigue"**. Fatigue can be *specific*, in that you may not be able to do another pushup, but you are able to rows just fine, or fatigue can be *systemic*, meaning that you're tired overall.

The basic way fitness increases is due to **supercompensation**. During a workout, you do some damage to your body, a **stressing stimulus**. The body then decides it needs to be better prepared for next time, so it adapts, which means your fitness goes up to be able to what you did last time (the compensation part), and a bit more just to be safe (the super part). If you want to keep increasing your fitness, you need to increase the stimulus so it becomes stressing again. This is called **progressive resistance**.

## Progressive Overload
One of the most well-known training principles is Progressive Overload. The idea is that as you recover from your training and your fitness level increase you'll need to accordingly increase the stimulus in your training session to compensate and keep improving. That means that you'll have to increase load, increase volume, reduce rest, anything that will give a better stimulus as long as the method used fits your goals.

With bodyweight training progressively overloading intensity is done with progressions - changing from one exercise to a harder one. Usually those exercises use different leverages and different muscular activation to make it harder. There's usually a significant difference in intensity with progressions, though, so to bridge the gap overloading by increasing reps are used before changing progression. This is not a bad way to go about it - when done right this ensures sustainable strength gains (as it provides some room for variety and set back accommodation a bit) and while more common with bodyweight training (out of necessity) there is a significant amount people who prefer this approach with weights too. Key here is that it should be done right, with a definite rep range that's not too narrow or too broad. As a reference the Recommended Routine uses 5-8 reps.

## Intensity, Frequency, Volume and Workload
We define **intensity** to be the load of the exercises you do on the muscles. With weightlifting this is defined by the amount of weight you lift during each of your repetitions, but in bodyweight training intensity can be hard to measure. We usually use repetitions to give an estimate of the intensity. Note that intensity is a characteristic of the exercise. Circuit training can be intense in the everyday sense, but that doesn't mean the exercises are high intensity by our definition.  
We usually talk about intensity in terms of percentage of 1RM. Your 1RM is the maximum load you can handle for exactly one repetition.

We define **frequency** to be how often you perform the exercises. In most beginner programs the frequency is typically 3 times a week with one rest day in between workout days.

We define **volume** to be the total amount of reps you do. So if you do 3 sets of 5 pushups, your total volume for pushups is 15 reps. We often refer to total pushing volume (if you do 3 sets of 5 pushups and 3 sets of 5 dips, your total pushing volume is 30 reps), but most commonly we mean the total volume in one workout. Sometimes it's also helpful to consider volume over the span of a week, in which case frequency is also part of the volume, but we will not discuss that here.

We define the **workload** to be volume times frequency times intensity, ie. the product of volume, frequency and intensity. It gives an indicator of the overall stress of your program.

So how do these variables interact? The basic idea is that the workload you can handle at a certain point in time is fixed. Then if you want to do super intense workouts, you'll have to ease off on the volume and the frequency. If you want to do super frequent workouts, you're going to have to ease off on the intensity and volume. And if you want to do super high volume workouts, you're going to have to ease off on the frequency and the intensity. Programming works by trying to find a balance between these three variables. We'll see how this plays out in practice in the next section.

## Law of Diminishing Returns, Accommodation and Variety
When you're a beginner you'll make incredible progress. However, as you get stronger you'll notice progressing in general will become harder and harder. This is called the Law of Diminishing Returns. Similarly, if you use a certain method of training for a while you'll notice that it will become harder to progress with that specific method. This is called Accommodation. While very similar those concepts are different: the law of diminishing return is usually used with a more general scope and it's pretty much irreversible (except for detraining), while accommodation is more specific to the exercise or training method used and there are ways to deal with it. 

To avoid accommodation and keep your training efficient you'll need to introduce some variety in your training, which can come in different flavours: different loads, sets and reps, exercises, tempo, training modalities, etc. This variety may also promote a more "well-rounded" development, while helping to further stimulus your weak links and better conditionate you to the kind of training you're doing.

However, here's the catch: variety must be planned correctly. Accommodation is not a process that happens overnight - it's a somewhat subtle process that should be planned for a broader time frame. That means that too much variety is inefficient. Also, while variety provides advantages to our training we should never forget about the importance of specificity and other factors like volume and frequency. A simple suggestion is to stick with the same exercises for about 2-4 months. People often either include too much variety or do changes too radical that aren't gonna help them with their goals.

## Individual Differences
Much of the knowledge we have is based on scientific studies done on certain populations. However we have to understand that not everyone is equal and people may respond different to all sorts of training protocols and exercises. It's not because most people have optimal results with 3 sets that your optimal number of sets is 3. What works for an advanced athlete is not necessarily what will work for a beginner. Take that into account when listening to advice from others. It's okay to experiment a bit now and then to figure out what works for you. Taking that into account is very important specially as you transition to intermediate levels. [Here's a great read on the topic](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/67iu4u/youre_not_average_but_youre_still_normal/).

## In practice: MWF Schedule
A MWF schedule is the following: you workout on monday, wednesday and friday and have the other days off (or any 3x a week fullbody program). A lot of beginner programs use this type of schedule, for instance our Beginner Routine and Starting Strength. The main use of this type of schedule is to improve overall strength, how much weight you can lift.

Looking at intensity, frequency and volume, we see that the MWF schedule favours intensity (it's meant to improve overall strength), and tries to balance frequency and volume equally around that. Should you try this protocol with a higher frequency (doing the workouts more often), the high intensity will probably make you run into overuse injuries as you exceed the workload you can handle.

As far as the SAID principle goes, you'll see that these programs try to keep the variety to a minimum, only providing the necessary movements to build overall strength.

## In practice: Split Routines
In a split routine you train different muscle groups in different days of the week. A lot of hypertrophy-focused routines use training splits.

This method of training is usually tailored towards hypertrophy and values volume over frequency. Intensity usually varies with compound exercises recruiting larger muscles groups at heavier loads and isolation work with smaller muscles at lighter loads and more reps. When working for hypertrophy people also uses methods tailored specifically for hypertrophy, like drop sets. While those methods may bring good gains in muscle mass which are strongly related to strength the SAID principle still apply and this may not be the best method for maximal strength development.

## In practice: Greasing the Groove
The grease the groove protocol (shorter: GTG) is a protocol to improve your performance on a single exercise, say pullups. The way it works is that throughout the day you do short sets of a couple pullups, never working maximally. The key to the protocol is that you need to be doing the short sets often.

Looking at intensity, frequency and volume, we see that GTG prioritizes frequency over intensity and volume in order to keep the workload balanced. Would you try GTG with more intensity (while keeping volume and frequency constant), you'd probably run into overuse injuries as you exceed the workload you can handle. It is possible to do GTG with more intensity, but then the volume has to go down (or frequency, but frequency is kind of the defining characteristic of the GTG protocol).

While we're at it, we can also highlight the SAID principle. If you do GTG with pull-ups, you're going to get a lot better at doing pullups because you get a lot of practice with the movement (the high frequency makes up for the low volume). However, you're not going to get much better at, say, rows, because you're not really stressing the muscles (the muscles for rows and pull-ups have a lot of carryover) to get stronger as much as you're practicing a movement.

## In practice: Circuit Training
Circuit training is a method where you do a "round" consisting of a bunch of exercises with little to no rest, with medium to little rest between rounds. This method is meant to combine resistance training with cardiovascular training, but while it does stimulates positive adaptations for both it is very inefficient at both. It's clear why when we consider specificity of training - this method is meant to be "generic" and as such is not specific at all.

This is not inherently bad. Some people simply doesn't have any specific goals or care for optimal progress and just wants to "get moving" as a way to be healthier. For those people combining cardio and resistance training is enough and have the advantage of being short on time. However for those with more clear goals and more time circuit training is not advisable.

# Beginner, intermediate and advanced practitioners
In this section, we will discuss what we typically mean by the terms "beginner" and "intermediate/advanced", which is a bit different from the layman definition. We will also consider differences in training between these two groups.

## Beginner
By definition, a **beginner** is someone who can progress each workout, ie. increase volume or intensity (add repetitions or weight). Virtually everyone who starts training will experience a beginner phase. Beginners recover (and as such, progress) quickly because they are still learning how to properly move their body and activate the correct musculature.

Training for beginners is very straightforward: you do a solid program and try to add reps or increase the intensity every workout.

## Intermediate
Once you can't make progress every workout anymore, you're an **intermediate**. There is no arbitrary strength level (like being able to do L-sit pullups) at which you automatically become intermediate, it is different for everyone. Intermediates don't recover as quickly as beginners, because the stressing stimulus they have to use to stimulate supercompensation is much heavier.

Here training starts to become more complex: you're going to have to play around with volume, frequency and intensity to make gains. This is called **periodisation**. The basic idea of periodisation is to apply a stressing stimulus and then allow the body to recover while preventing any loss of skill. For someone just out of the beginner phase, light-heavy or volume-light-heavy periodisation are solid options. However, if you are still able to progress every other workout, it's a good idea to check which option will give you the best results, since progressing every other workout may be faster than periodizing.

Note that you will probably get somewhere in between intermediate and beginner. Some exercises you might get stuck on and have to apply periodisation to, while you can still progress every workout on other exercises.

## Advanced
There isn't really a great distinction between intermediate and advanced. It's just that the periodisation structure is going to change over time, to be more and more complex. Progress is going to slow down as you get closer and closer to what your genetics and proportions allow. At this point you really should have a good handle on what works for you.

A typical advanced periodisation schedule is daily undulating periodisation.

# Energy Systems
In order for your muscles to contract, they need energy. The specific molecule that carries the energy inside the muscle cell is called **ATP**. There are roughly three ways the muscles come by ATP and each energy system is used as needed since they provide different. One important thing to understand is that your body doesn't "switch" from one type to the other and use different proportions of it depending on the rate of the energetic demand - that means that as energy demand increases or lowers the use of the other energy systems smoothly varies accordingly. Another thing to know is that general training principles like specificity and progressive overload also applies to the energy systems.

## ATP-CP System
The ATP-CP system, or the phosphagen system. Basically, the muscle cell has a small reservoir of ATP that is available immediately. It also has a reservoir of creatine-phosphate, or CP. As the ATP is used it releases energy and becomes adenosine-diphosphate (or ADP) which quickly interacts with the CP and becomes ATP again. This is a **very** fast process to replenish ATP. However, this system provides ATP for up to 10 seconds, which means it's the energy system you're using on maximal intensity exercises like sprinting and handstand pushups.

After this system is used you can't keep peak performance no matter what, but you still can keep doing things at fairly high intensities thanks to the Anaerobic Glygolysis system. While it's the quickest to provide energy, it's also the slowest to regenerate. It typically takes 3 minutes to replenish about 80 percent of the ATP and CP stores, but it can take over 5 minutes to replenish them fully.

## Anaerobic Glycolysis System
When the ATP-CP system runs out, the muscle cells need to get their energy from elsewhere. This energy comes from **glycogen** which basically is a whole bunch of glucose (sugar) molecules packed together. The muscle cell breaks down this glycogen (**glycolysis**) to produce something called pyruvate, which the body can turn into ATP without having to use oxygen. This process generates very few ATP but it can generate it pretty quickly (not nearly as quickly as the ATP-CP system, but lasting way longer). As a byproduct of this process the body also produces lactate which have to be dealt with. Usually, your body manages to "recycle" most of the lactate into energy, but when production exceeds removal rate lactate starts to accumulate in the muscle and that's what causes "the burn".

This system is useful for up to 3 minutes of exercise at higher intensities, until lactic acid concentrations become too high. On moderate intensities when lactic acid build-up isn't a big problem then it can be used for a very long time. Recovery time for this system is highly variable as it depends on the amount of lactic acid still in the muscle and your own body's ability to handle it.

## Aerobic System
In the presence of oxygen, the muscle cells can produce a lot of energy. The aerobic system can use both glucose and free fatty-acids to generate energy. However, this requires a lot of oxygen, and is a rather slow process. So while this system provides a lot of energy at once the amount of energy per unit of time is the lesser among all systems. As your energetic demands increase your body have to rely on the other energy systems to keep up with the demand, but this system still helps. This system can be sustained pretty much indefinitely and it's the system you're relying when running marathons - of course at some point you'll fatigue for other reasons, though. This is the system that feeds your metabolism and keep you alive so treat it well.

# Factors in Fitness
Your ideas about what "fitness" is may vary, but it's important to understand what we are saying when we talk about "strength", "cardio" and "agility" and how these concepts interrelate.

## Strength
**Strength** usually means peak strength, which is defined as the ability to move a high load for one repetition. The higher the load, the higher the strength required. A [90 degree pushup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rghpvUUy7bA) requires more strength than a regular pushup.

## Anaerobic Endurance
**Anaerobic endurance** is defined as the ability to perform an exercise for a long period of time where the energy for your muscles is being provided by anaerobic glycolysis. Typically this is done with exercises which have a medium load, like pushups.

## Aerobic Endurance/Cardio
**Aerobic endurance** is defined as the ability to perform an exercise for a long period of time where the energy for your muscles is being provided by aerobic glycolysis. These are done with the lightest loads, like just walking or running.


# From the Old FAQ
## What about circuit training?
Circuit training is ineffective for both strength and hypertrophy, so we do not recommend it if either of those are your goal.  Programs such as "The 7 minute workout" are inefficient for almost all goals.

## Time Concerns
A routine consisting of a warmup, skill work, strength work for a few exercises and appropriate flexibility work can take a lot of time. Not everyone has that time.

The first good timesaver is to do mobility and flexibility work on off days. They are non-taxing and may even help out a bit with recovery.

The second concerns strength work. If you're doing mobility on off days, but your strength routine still takes too long, consider pairing exercises. Say, you normally work out with pushups and rows, with about 3 minutes of rest in between sets. To pair them, you simply perform a set of pushups, rest 1.5 minutes (so half of 3 minutes), do a set of rows and rest another 1.5 minutes. Then you do another set of pushups, rest 1.5 minutes, etc. The reason this works is because pushups and rows don't use that many overlapping muscles, so the rowing does not have a big impact on the rest you're taking for pushups and vice versa. You can also pair three exercises (push, pull, legs) in this manner if you really have to.

If you still are crunched for time, you can consider dropping exercises or splitting volume between workout days.
