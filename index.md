# Welcome to the Recommended Routine

**This routine will cover the following goals:**

 * Strength
 * Hypertrophy/Muscle Gain (provided your [diet](https://thefitness.wiki/improving-your-diet/) is aligned for this goal)
 * Fat Loss (provided your [diet](https://thefitness.wiki/improving-your-diet/) is aligned for this goal)
 * Check the [goals page for more details](/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/goals) to see if this routine will help you reach your goals.

**Overall Structure of this Routine:**

 * **Warm Up**
     * Dynamic stretches
     * Joint prep
     * Movement practice

 * **Strength Work**
     * 6 exercises, put in pairs (explained below) to target all the major muscle groups in your upper and lower body
     * 3 exercises in a triplet to target improving your core strength

* **You will need access to:**
     * A place to do Rows (Low Bar, or Gymnastics Rings, a Sturdy Table, or even [a knotted bedsheet in a door](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wr8ZA-cvH3s); This is ***non negotiable*** regardless of physical skill level. Rows are absolutely integral to the quality of the routine and cannot be substituted.)
     * A place to do pull ups, if you are at the point in the program where you add pull-ups (monkey bars, Pull-up bar, rings, etc). Additional alternatives in the [FAQ](/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/faq#wiki_i_have_no_equipment_to_do_pullups_.2F_rows_.2F_dips.21)
     * [Parallel Bars](http://antranik.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/antranik-holding-support-hold-on-parallel-bars.jpg) (There are progressions that can be done in place of these once you have reached the appropriate level which do not require these, so if you absolutely cannot find the corner of a kitchen counter, two sturdy chairs, or anything like that, do not let this bar you from starting.)



## Weekly Schedule

* 3x a week, with at least one rest day (or [skill day](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/skillday)) in between workout days.

* Examples: Monday, Wednesday, Friday (MWF) or Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday (TuThSat) or Wednesday, Friday, Sunday (WFSun). Whatever fits your schedule.

* Don't purposely split the workout into separate days unless you have to. It's meant to be a full body workout.  Here's [why](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/6talge/split_routines_tend_to_be_suboptimal_for_beginners/).


## How Progressions Work

* It's hard to adjust the difficulty of bodyweight exercises like with weight training by using heavier dumbells or barbells. Therefore, you need to use different variations of an exercise to increase the difficulty. For example, some may find a push-up on its own too difficult or too easy. Therefore, variations of the pushup exist to make it easer (e.g. incline push-ups or knee pushups) or harder (decline, diamond, ring, pseudo planche etc. push-ups). Generally, you will pick a variation that is appropriate to your strength level as too easy or too difficult will make things harder to progress.

* When starting the strength portion of the Recommended Routine, you will be greeted with progression exercises listed in order of increasing difficulty. Pick an appropriately difficult progression for your current level of strength, and perform 3 sets of 5 reps of that progression on your first session. In subsequent sessions you should try to add one rep per set until you are performing 3 sets of 8 reps with good form. From here you should move on to the next progression, but again at 3 sets of 5 reps. Note that this means that you only perform *one* of the exercises from each of the listed progressions in each session. Once you move up in the progression, there's no need to keep the easier exercises in your routine (except for using it as a warm-up if you feel like it).

* Some of the exercises are isometrics (or static) holds, such as the support holds or the "tuck front lever" in the rowing progression. Instead of dynamic reps, one set here consists of simply holding the position statically for 10-30 seconds. Move on to the next harder progression once you hit 30 seconds for all 3 sets.

* You'll see there are multiple "progression paths" for the exercises. However, don't overthink this - if you're not sure pick the main progression and do it. If for some reason you can't follow the main progression (lack of specific equipment, for example) then pick one of the alternatives and do it.

 **Note: Mobile users, if the above links don't work then [click here](/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/exercises/core) and manually scroll to each section.**

**Instructions:** There are nine exercises. These exercises are performed in pairs and triplets to save time. Pairing two exercises means doing a set of the first exercise, resting 90 seconds, then doing a set of the second exercise, resting 90 seconds, and repeating until you've done 3 sets of that pair. For the triplet, you do a set of the first exercise, rest 60 seconds, do a set of the second exercise, rest 60 seconds, do a set of the third exercise, rest 60 seconds, and repeating until you've done 3 sets of that triplet.  See the FAQs below if you're still confused.

**Rest time:** If 90 seconds is not enough and you are starting to drop drops (e.g. you did 8 reps the first set, but the next set of the same exercise you can only do 5-6 reps), you can rest up to 3 minutes. Quality is more important than reducing time. 

**Tempo:** Ideally, all exercises are to be performed in "10X0" (1,0,X,O)  tempo. The numbers explain how long each phase should last, and go in the order of: (1 second eccentric) On the way Down / (0 second) Pause at the Bottom / (X - accelerating fast concentric) On the way up / (0 second) Pause at the top. So 10X0 means 1 'mississippi' second duration on the way down, no pause at the bottom, explode up and no pause at the top. When "exploding up", if the actual movement is slow, that's okay, it's the intent that matters.

Overall, if your pull-up max is say 8 reps, then go for one rep short of failure such as 7-7-7 instead of 8-6-5. The key is to not work at failure for the first set or two because it significantly detracts from performance in later sets which reduces your ability to perform good reps and maximize volume to get stronger and bigger muscles. The 90 second pairing is so that there is minimum 3 minutes rest between each set, which is 3 minutes total. This rest time is where there is 99% replenishment of ATP in the muscles, so you are not limited by fatigue in the muscles. Sticking with failure-1 repetitions and 3 total minutes between sets of the same exercise allows you to maximize volume and effort level which is essential for strength and hypertrophy. See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/7ab7c6/strict_form_vs_reps/dp8xymm/) for more discussion.

**That's it! You're done! It's over! You did it!**

# Frequently Asked Questions


### The Recommended Routine (RR) is too much for me as a beginner. What can I do?

Some common modifications to the Recommended Routine include the following:

* Reducing the sets in the exercises to 1-2 instead of the full 3. This can help sedentary beginners or those for whom the RR volume is too much adapt into the routine much better
* Reduce the amount of days per week you do the routine. For example, going from 3x per week to 2x per week
* Splitting the RR into 2 separate routines like a 2 day split. For example, going to an "upper/lower split" where you have all of the upper body exercises on one day, and lower body + core on the other day. This can be done on a MWFSat for optimal rest distribution on a weekly schedule or MTuThF schedule if you like weekends free.
* If it's still a bit too much, and you're new, you can either remove the core triple or just pick one of the 1 push, 1 pull, and 1 legs exercise to start. For instance, squat progression, pushups progression, and rows progression. 

The set reduction method and increasing them over time if you need more is the preferred recommendation.

Alternatively, the [minimalist routine](/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/minroutine) is similar to the last bullet point if you want to just do something without thinking about it.


### **I Don't Have This Much Time!**

 This routine is about an hour long if you don't mess around and do the work. As a general rule, you should try and find this time somewhere. Make it a priority.  
 However, if it's really not happening, here are the things you can do in order of not-badness (the further down the list, the more "last ditch effort" it becomes):

 * Make triplets rather than pairs, like pull-ups, rest 50s, squats, rest 50s, dips, rest 50s, repeat. (saves ~10 minutes, but not recommended.)
 * Do just the warm-up, and a single triplet (so cut six exercises). (saves ~10 minutes, but really, really not recommended)
 * Don't workout at all (saves anywhere from 20 to 60 minutes, but really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really not recommended)

Other options to reduce time:

* Place any skill work such as handstands on off days
* Put any mobility or flexibility work on off days
* Split the workout in two such as upper body and lower body and do them on alternate days


### **Integrating Barbell Squats and Deadlifts**

 The basic process works as follows:

 * You replace the squat progression by *squats*, 3 sets of 5 repetitions.
 * The 1st and 3rd workout of the week, you replace the hinge progression by *romanian deadlifts (weighted)*, 3 set of 8 repetitions.
 * The 2nd workout of the week, you replace the hinge progression by *deadlifts*, 3 sets of 5 repetitions.

Thus, every week, you will be squatting thrice, romanian deadlifting twice, and deadlifting once

Before you do your "work sets" it's a good idea to warm up with less weight for squats and deadlifts: first do a bunch of reps with just the bar, then add weight and do another (slightly smaller) bunch of reps, then add more weight and do another (smaller still) bunch of reps, etc. until you are at the weight you want to be squatting at.

As for actually selecting a weight: the first time, start with just the bar. Then add weights in increments you feel comfortable with. Try to add some weight every workout at first.


### **Can you switch the order of the exercises?**

Yes, as long as you leave the warm-up in the warm-up, and the strength work in the strength work.


### **When do I move on to an intermediate routine?**

When you start plateauing (not making progress) for long periods of time (weeks) while your diet, nutrition, and stress levels are in check. You can also move on if you exhaust all the progressions. Or whenever you feel like, but that may not be optimal.

As to what intermediate routine you should do, that depends on your goals. If you don't know what those are, you'd better start thinking about it! Bodyweight training is very varied, and this routine will have given you a solid basis for most other things you might want to get into. We recommend you develop your own intermediate routine. A short guide can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/training_guide#wiki_developing_an_intermediate_routine).


### **Can I do this every day?**

No. If it were more effective that way, we wouldn't have made it a 3x a week routine. You get stronger and bigger when you rest. For more elaboration, see the FAQ on [can I train every day?](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/faq#wiki_can_i_train_everyday.3F)

### **How soon will I see results?**

In your ability to do the exercises, expect progress to start about 2-3 workouts in. Physique progress, 4-6 weeks for you to notice it yourself, 12+ weeks for someone else to notice it. Provided your diet is in check.


### **Where's the work for the arms and shoulders?**

How are you planning on doing push-ups, rows, dips, and pull-ups without arms? Seriously though, all the exercises in the strength section are compound exercises, meaning they use major muscle groups simultaneously. Most bodyweight exercises are like this (as opposed to isolation exercises). Pushups, dips use the chest and triceps. Pullups and rows use the upper back (lats, etc), biceps and forearms (by gripping).  If you want more work for your forearms, check out /r/griptraining. 

If you want to know in detail which exercises work which muscles and why they are included, [read this thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/5ipiyd/trying_to_find_a_detailed_breakdown_of_reasoning/)


### **Is it okay if I make XYZ modification to the routine?**

You can make whatever changes you like, but if there was something we could change in the routine to improve results right off the bat for everyone, we would have changed that. The routine is set up in the way it is for various reasons that are too complicated to get into here, and very few of the design decisions were arbitrary. If you don't know what you're doing, stick with the routine as written. If you want to learn more about why the routine is set up the way it is, start reading the Basic Programming Principles in our [Concept Wednesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/weekly/conceptwednesday) series.

See also: [Why Beginners shouldn't modify the Recommended Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/41wffd/fyi_for_beginners_do_not_attempt_to_modify_the/) and [Why switching up your exercises a lot is a bad idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/4oddzi/why_switching_up_your_exercises_a_lot_is_a_bad/)


### **This felt way too easy! Is something wrong?**

Give it some time. Make sure you're doing the hardest progressions you can do for 3 sets of 5 to 8 reps. This can take some figuring out in the beginning, so stick with it for a couple weeks and then reevaluate. Besides, soreness does not necessarily equate to growth.

### **Which is better, this routine, or the Startbodyweight routine?**

 The general consensus is that the Startbodyweight routine is a solid routine for all of strength, hypertrophy, and fat loss (provided you eat correctly), so it doesn't really matter, so pick one and *get going*. Indecision is no use if you're not working out.

 [Thread 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/2l1zse/startbodyweight_vs_fitloop/), [thread 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/2d2x2o/is_startbodyweightcoms_basic_routine_any_good/).


### **Which is better, this routine, or the GymnasticBodies Foundation program?**

**We specifically do NOT recommend any of GB's materials. [Sommer threatened to sue bodyweightfitness members for posting bad reviews of his program and seminars](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/program_reviews#wiki_christopher_sommer.27s_.2F_gymnasticbodies_foundation)**.

With that said, the GymnasticBodies series have a very different flavour compared to our routines, so this a decision you'll have to make on your own. You can find our review page of the program [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/program_reviews/gb_foundation) (might be a little out of date). Here are some threads about our routine versus Foundation in specific: [thread 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/2to9ve/gb_foundation_vs_oglike_routine_like_the_one/), [thread 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1eny1w/starting_out_foundation_vs_reddit_bodyweight/), and also make sure to give /u/FatManDan's [Reasons for Slow Progress on the Foundation Series](http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/2o4xcw/reasons_for_slow_progress_on_foundation_series/) ([part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/359pwr/reasons_for_slow_progress_on_foundation_series/)) a read.

### **What about Bar Brothers / BarStarzz / Convict Conditioning / Freeletics / Insanity / P90X / THENX / etcetera?**

* A directory of reviews for similar and not-so-similar fitness programs may be found in our knowledge base located [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/program_reviews).


### **This is great, but I'd like something more skill-oriented. Do you have anything that can fit the bill?**

 * Give our [Move](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/move) programming a look. It'll help increase your motor skills and balance while strengthening your body. If you don't care about any strength work, give our [Skill Day Routine](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/skillday) a look!

### **Do I rest 90sec between EVERY exercise? What are Pairs? I'm confused how it works.**

**Pairs are sets of exercises combined together by switching after every set instead of doing 3 sets of 1 exercise, and then 3 sets of another. This saves overall time.**

 This is how it should be done:

First pair: Pull-Ups & Squats

    Pull-Ups, rest 90sec, Squats, rest 90sec
    Pull-Ups, rest 90sec, Squats, rest 90sec
    Pull-Ups, rest 90sec, Squats, rest 90sec

Second pair Dips & Hinge

    Dips, rest 90sec, Hinge, rest 90sec
    Dips, rest 90sec, Hinge, rest 90sec
    Dips, rest 90sec, Hinge, rest 90sec

Third pair: Rows & Push-ups

    Rows, rest 90sec, Push-ups, rest 90sec
    Rows, rest 90sec, Push-ups, rest 90sec
    Rows, rest 90sec, Push-ups, rest 90sec

Core Triplet 

    anti-extension, rest 60sec, anti-rotation, rest 60sec, extension, rest 60sec
    anti-extension, rest 60sec, anti-rotation, rest 60sec, extension, rest 60sec
    anti-extension, rest 60sec, anti-rotation, rest 60sec, extension, 5ever/until next workout day

### **The Recommended Routine looks different from how I remember, but I can't quite place my finger on it...🤔** 

* We released a big update in the Summer of 2018! The changes are detailed [in this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/8ywetr/recommended_routine_update_again). 

* You may find the classic Recommended Routine from 2017 in the wiki [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine_2017).
